# Coordination Protocol Changelog

## 2025-08-30: Consolidated Task Assignment Logging

### Change Summary
Replaced multiple individual `task_assigned` events with a single consolidated `all_tasks_assigned` event.

### Previous Behavior
- One `task_assigned` event logged per worker in the loop
- Multiple events created noise in the event log
- Difficult to see the complete task distribution at a glance

### New Behavior
- Single `all_tasks_assigned` event after all workers configured
- Contains comprehensive details for all worker assignments in one event
- Includes: total workers, worker list, and detailed assignments with:
  - Task descriptions
  - Focus areas
  - Priority levels
  - Timeout values
  - Dependencies

### Benefits
- Cleaner event log with reduced noise
- Better overview of complete task distribution
- Easier to track when all assignments are complete
- More efficient event processing

### Event Structure
```json
{
  "event_type": "all_tasks_assigned",
  "details": {
    "total_workers": 3,
    "workers": ["worker1", "worker2", "worker3"],

    },
    "complexity_level": 3,
