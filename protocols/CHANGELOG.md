# Coordination Protocol Changelog

## 2025-08-30: Protocol Enhancements

### Enhanced Debug Logging for Exception Handling

#### Change Summary
Added comprehensive debug logging before all exception raises across protocol files to improve troubleshooting and error tracking.

#### Changes Made
1. **Enhanced BaseProtocol** (`protocol_loader.py`):
   - Added `log_debug()` method with append-only file operations
   - Ensures DEBUG.jsonl is never overwritten, always appended to
   - Silent failure handling to prevent cascading errors

2. **Updated Exception Handling**:
   - **worker_prompt_protocol.py**: Added debug logging for prompt validation failures
   - **synthesis_protocol.py**: Simplified debug logging using BaseProtocol method
   - **startup_protocol.py**: Replaced complex debug logging with standardized approach
   - **session_protocol.py**: Streamlined debug logging for session configuration errors

3. **Debug Log Safety**:
   - All debug logging uses append mode ('a') to prevent file overwriting
   - File existence checks with automatic creation if missing
   - Exception handling in debug logging to prevent cascading failures

#### Benefits
- Improved troubleshooting with detailed error context
- Consistent debug logging format across all protocols
- Enhanced error tracking in DEBUG.jsonl files
- Safer file operations with append-only writes

#### Technical Details
- Debug entries include timestamp, level, agent, message, and detailed context
- All exceptions now have proper debug logging before being raised
- Unified approach eliminates duplicate logging code

### Consolidated Task Assignment Logging

#### Change Summary
Replaced multiple individual `task_assigned` events with a single consolidated `all_tasks_assigned` event.

#### Previous Behavior
- One `task_assigned` event logged per worker in the loop
- Multiple events created noise in the event log
- Difficult to see the complete task distribution at a glance

#### New Behavior
- Single `all_tasks_assigned` event after all workers configured
- Contains comprehensive details for all worker assignments in one event
- Includes: total workers, worker list, and detailed assignments with:
  - Task descriptions
  - Focus areas
  - Priority levels
  - Timeout values
  - Dependencies

#### Benefits
- Cleaner event log with reduced noise
- Better overview of complete task distribution
- Easier to track when all assignments are complete
- More efficient event processing

#### Event Structure
```json
{
  "event_type": "all_tasks_assigned",
  "details": {
    "total_workers": 3,
    "workers": ["worker1", "worker2", "worker3"],
    "assignments": {
      "worker1": {
        "task": "...",
        "focus_areas": [...],
        "priority": 1,
        "timeout": 300,
        "dependencies": []
      }
    },
    "complexity_level": 3,
    "status": "all_workers_configured"
  }
}
```
