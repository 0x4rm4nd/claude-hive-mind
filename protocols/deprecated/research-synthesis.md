# üî¨ Research Synthesis Command

Synthesizing Context7 research findings from all workers for session **$SESSION_ID**.

## Research Synthesis Protocol

### Step 1: Load Session and Validate Research Phase
```bash
SESSION_ID="$SESSION_ID"
SESSION_DIR="Docs/hive-mind/sessions/${SESSION_ID}"

if [ ! -d "${SESSION_DIR}" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Session ${SESSION_ID} not found"
  exit 1
fi

cd "${SESSION_DIR}"

# Check if we're in research phase
STATUS=$(jq -r '.status' STATE.json)
RESEARCH_COMPLETE=$(jq -r '.research_complete' STATE.json)

echo "# Research Synthesis - Session ${SESSION_ID}"
echo ""
echo "**Current Status**: ${STATUS}"
echo "**Research Complete**: ${RESEARCH_COMPLETE}"
echo ""

if [ "$STATUS" != "research_phase" ] && [ "$RESEARCH_COMPLETE" = "true" ]; then
  echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è Research phase already complete, generating updated synthesis..."
else
  echo "üîÑ Research phase active, synthesizing current findings..."
fi
echo ""
```

### Step 2: Collect Research from All Workers
```bash
echo "## üìä Research Collection Status"
echo ""

# Check research status from each worker
workers=("researcher" "backend" "frontend" "service-architect" "analyzer" "test" "devops" "designer")

echo "### Worker Research Status"
for worker in "${workers[@]}"; do
  worker_file="workers/${worker}-worker-notes.md"
  
  if [ -s "$worker_file" ]; then
    lines=$(wc -l < "$worker_file")
    research_entries=$(grep -c -i "context7\|research\|mcp__context7\|library\|framework" "$worker_file" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    
    if [ "$research_entries" -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "‚úÖ **${worker}**: ${lines} lines, ${research_entries} research entries"
    else
      echo "üìù **${worker}**: ${lines} lines, no explicit research entries"
    fi
  else
    echo "‚ùå **${worker}**: No notes file found"
  fi
done
echo ""
```

### Step 3: Extract and Organize Research Findings
```bash
echo "## üîç Research Findings Extraction"
echo ""

# Create comprehensive research synthesis
cat > RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md << EOF
# Research Synthesis: $(jq -r '.task' STATE.json)

**Session ID**: ${SESSION_ID}
**Synthesis Date**: $(date -Iseconds)
**Status**: $(jq -r '.status' STATE.json)

      echo "" >> RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md
      
      echo "‚úÖ Extracted research from ${worker} worker"
    fi
  fi

**Total Research Lines**: $(find workers -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} + 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}' || echo "0")

**Next Phase**: Implementation planning based on synthesized research findings

**Quality Assurance**: Research recommendations validated across multiple worker perspectives

echo "The research findings have been unified into a comprehensive implementation strategy."
echo "Queen can now proceed with research-informed task breakdown and worker assignments."
```

## Usage

This command creates a comprehensive research synthesis by:

- **Collecting** all worker research findings
- **Organizing** technology recommendations by domain
- **Resolving** conflicts between worker recommendations  
- **Integrating** SmartWalletFX-specific requirements
- **Documenting** unified implementation strategy
- **Preparing** for research-informed implementation phase

The result is a unified `RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md` that serves as the foundation for all subsequent implementation decisions.
