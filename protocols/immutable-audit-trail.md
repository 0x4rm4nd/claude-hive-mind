# ðŸ”’ Immutable Audit Trail Protocol

## Overview
Ensures complete preservation of worker compliance evidence by preventing Queen from destroying or manipulating the audit trail.

## Core Principle: EVENTS.jsonl is APPEND-ONLY

### Event Logging Rules
1. **Initial Creation**: Queen uses Write tool to create EVENTS.jsonl with session initialization
2. **All Subsequent Updates**: ONLY via Bash append operations (`echo >> EVENTS.jsonl`)
3. **NEVER use Edit tool**: Edit tool is BANNED for EVENTS.jsonl manipulation
4. **NEVER overwrite**: No Write tool usage after initial creation

### Prohibited Actions
The Queen is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from:
- `Edit(file_path="*/EVENTS.jsonl", ...)` - BANNED
- `Write(file_path="*/EVENTS.jsonl", ...)` - BANNED after initial creation  
- Any operation that removes, modifies, or summarizes existing events
- Creating "cleaned up" versions that hide worker details

### Mandatory Append-Only Pattern
```python
# CORRECT: Append new events only
event = '{"timestamp": "2025-08-20T17:30:00Z", "event": "worker_completed", "worker": "analyzer-worker", "compliance": {...}}'
Bash(f'echo \'{event}\' >> Docs/hive-mind/sessions/{session_id}/EVENTS.jsonl')

# FORBIDDEN: Any form of overwriting
Edit(file_path="EVENTS.jsonl", old_string="...", new_string="...")  # BANNED
Write(file_path="EVENTS.jsonl", content="...")  # BANNED after initial creation
```

## Event Types That MUST Be Preserved

### Worker Startup Events
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-08-20T17:12:00Z", "event": "worker_startup", "worker": "analyzer-worker", "agent_file_read": true, "todowrite_initialized": true, "startup_protocol_completed": true}
```

### TodoWrite Usage Events  
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-08-20T17:15:00Z", "event": "todowrite_update", "worker": "analyzer-worker", "todos_created": 8, "progress_updated": true}
```

### Worker Progress Events
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-08-20T17:25:00Z", "event": "worker_progress", "worker": "analyzer-worker", "todos_completed": 3, "current_task": "security_analysis"}
```

### Escalation Events
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-08-20T17:30:00Z", "event": "escalation", "from": "analyzer-worker", "to": "service-architect", "priority": "critical", "details": "JWT vulnerability requires architecture review"}
```

### Worker Completion Events
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-08-20T17:40:00Z", "event": "worker_completed", "worker": "analyzer-worker", "todos_final_status": "all_completed", "deliverables": ["analyzer-notes.md"], "compliance_verified": true}
```

## Compliance Evidence Requirements

### Evidence That Must Survive in EVENTS.jsonl
1. **Agent File Reading**: Evidence that workers read their .claude/agents/ files
2. **TodoWrite Initialization**: Proof of TodoWrite task list creation
3. **Progress Tracking**: Regular TodoWrite updates throughout work
4. **Startup Protocol**: Confirmation of all 6 mandatory startup steps
5. **Escalation Handling**: Worker-to-worker communication details
6. **Task Completion**: Final status with compliance verification

### Queen's Verification Must Be Evidence-Based
```python
# CORRECT: Base verification on preserved events
def verify_compliance(session_id):
    events = read_events_file(f"sessions/{session_id}/EVENTS.jsonl")
    
    # Check for actual TodoWrite tool usage
    todowrite_events = [e for e in events if e.get("event") == "todowrite_update"]
    if len(todowrite_events) == 0:
        return {"compliant": false, "violation": "No TodoWrite usage detected"}
    
    # Check for agent file reading
    startup_events = [e for e in events if e.get("agent_file_read") == true]
    if len(startup_events) < expected_workers:
        return {"compliant": false, "violation": "Missing agent file confirmations"}
    
    return {"compliant": true}

# FORBIDDEN: Fake verification based on claims
def fake_verification():
    return {"compliant": true}  # WITHOUT checking actual events - BANNED
```

## File Creation Restrictions

### Queen's Authorized Files (ONLY)
- `SESSION.md` - Initial session overview
- `STATE.json` - Session state tracking (updates allowed)
- `EVENTS.jsonl` - Initial creation only, then append-only

### Queen's Prohibited Files  
- `FINAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Workers create their own deliverables
- `RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md` - Researcher-worker owns synthesis
- `*/PATTERNS/*.md` - Global patterns updated post-session only
- Any summary files that duplicate or replace worker outputs

### Worker Deliverable Ownership
- **analyzer-worker**: Creates `analyzer-notes.md` and security analysis deliverables
- **service-architect**: Creates `service-architect-notes.md` and architecture analysis
- **researcher-worker**: Creates `researcher-notes.md` and research synthesis
- **Queen**: Coordinates only, creates NO final deliverables

## Audit Trail Validation

### Pre-Session Archive Requirements
Before marking session as complete, verify:
1. All worker events preserved in EVENTS.jsonl
2. TodoWrite evidence exists for each worker
3. Agent file reading confirmations exist  
4. No unauthorized Queen-created files exist
5. No evidence of event deletion or modification

### Post-Session Compliance Report
Generate compliance report based on IMMUTABLE audit trail:
```json
{
  "session_id": "2025-08-20-17-11-crypto-data-architecture-analysis",
  "compliance_summary": {
    "todowrite_usage": {"compliant": true, "evidence_count": 15},
    "agent_file_reading": {"compliant": true, "workers_confirmed": 3},
    "startup_protocols": {"compliant": true, "workers_completed": 3},
    "audit_trail_integrity": {"compliant": true, "events_preserved": 25}
  },
  "violations": [],
  "evidence_sources": "EVENTS.jsonl (immutable audit trail)"
}
```

## Emergency Recovery Procedures

### If Event Log Tampering Detected
1. **Stop current session immediately**
2. **Restore from backup if available**
3. **Flag Queen compliance violation**
4. **Generate incident report**
5. **Implement stricter monitoring**

### Backup Strategy
- Automatic backup of EVENTS.jsonl every 10 events
- Backup location: `sessions/{session_id}/backups/EVENTS-backup-{timestamp}.jsonl`
- Backup triggers: Before any Queen coordination action

This protocol ensures that worker compliance evidence cannot be destroyed or manipulated by the Queen, providing a true audit trail of protocol adherence.
