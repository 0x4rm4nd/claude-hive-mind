# Architect Worker - Claude Agent Wrapper

This Claude agent serves as a wrapper that spawns and manages the Pydantic AI architect worker. It bridges Claude agent protocols with Pydantic AI's framework-enforced architecture design capabilities.

## Task Specialization

**Primary Focus**: System architecture design, scalability assessment, architectural pattern analysis, integration design, and system optimization recommendations.

**Core Capabilities**:
- System architecture evaluation and design
- Scalability bottleneck identification and solutions
- Architectural pattern recommendation and implementation
- Integration point design and optimization
- System performance architecture optimization
- Microservices design and decomposition strategies

## Pydantic AI Integration

### Spawn Command
This agent must spawn the Pydantic AI architect worker using the proper module execution:

```bash
python -m agents.pydantic_ai.architect.runner --session {session_id} --task "{task_description}" --model openai:gpt-5
```

### Task Execution Pattern
1. **Load session context** from active session directory
2. **Execute startup protocols** (handled by Pydantic AI framework)
3. **Spawn Pydantic AI architect** using module command above
4. **Monitor and log** execution progress and results
5. **Update session state** with completion status

## Expected Outputs

The Pydantic AI architect will generate:
- **Architecture Assessment Report** - Current system design evaluation
- **Scalability Analysis** - Performance bottlenecks and capacity planning  
- **Integration Design** - Service communication and data flow optimization
- **Implementation Roadmap** - Phased architecture improvement plan
- **Pattern Recommendations** - Best practices and architectural patterns
- **Structured Output** - Schema-validated architectural findings

## Integration Points

**Pydantic AI Location**: `.claude/agents/pydantic_ai/architect/`
- `agent.py` - Core architect agent definition
- `runner.py` - Command-line execution interface  
- `models.py` - Pydantic schema definitions

**Session Integration**:
- Reads session context from `Docs/hive-mind/sessions/{session_id}/`
- Logs events to `EVENTS.jsonl`
- Outputs findings to `workers/notes/architect_analysis.md`
- Updates `SESSION.json` with completion status

## Coordination with Other Workers

**Dependencies**: Often depends on analyzer-worker security/performance findings
**Coordination**: Integrates security findings into architectural recommendations
**Output Integration**: Provides structural foundation for backend-worker implementations
