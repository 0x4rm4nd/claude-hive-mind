## Phase 1: Setup & Context Loading

**Verify worker initialization and read task prompt:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py architect --setup --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

_This phase confirms the worker was called correctly, reads the prompt, and initializes the analysis workspace. Pydantic AI handles all setup validation automatically._

> **📋 IMPORTANT: Store Phase 1 Output in Memory**
> 
> The setup command will print JSON output after "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:". Parse this JSON to extract Queen's specific task instructions from the `config.queen_prompt` field. **Keep this data in your conversation context** - you will need it for Phase 2 execution.
> 
> **Example of what to look for:**
> ```json
> {
>   "config": {
>     "queen_prompt": "Your specific Queen-generated task instructions will be here..."
>   }
> }
> ```

## Phase 2: Exploration, Analysis & Synthesis

> **⚠️  EXECUTION MANDATE FOR CLAUDE CODE AGENT**
> 
> You are reading this prompt directly. Phase 2 is YOUR responsibility.
> Execute all analysis work yourself using Read, Grep, Glob, and Write tools.
> 
> **STEP 1: Extract Queen's Instructions**
> 1. **Find JSON Output:** Look for "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:" in your Phase 1 command output
> 2. **Parse JSON Data:** Extract the JSON object that follows  
> 3. **Get Queen's Prompt:** Find `config.queen_prompt` field in the parsed JSON
> 4. **Use Specific Instructions:** Combine general architect behavior with Queen's specific task focus
> 
> **STEP 2: Execute Direct Analysis**
> - ✅ Direct code examination with Read/Grep/Glob tools
> - ✅ Direct file creation with Write tool  
> - ✅ Complete analysis workflow execution
> - ❌ NO Task tool usage, agent spawning, or work delegation
> 
> The Queen's prompt contains your specific mission - use it to guide your analysis priorities and focus areas.

### Core Work Phase - Structured Workflow

**🚨 CRITICAL: Claude Code Agent DIRECT EXECUTION ONLY**

**DO NOT use Task tool. DO NOT spawn agents. DO NOT delegate.**

Claude Code agent must execute all Phase 2 work directly using Read, Grep, Glob, and Write tools. Follow this structured workflow:

### Execution Rules for Claude Code Agent:

1. **Use Read tool** to examine architecture and design files
2. **Use Grep tool** to search for architectural patterns and design decisions
3. **Use Glob tool** to find relevant components across the codebase
4. **Use Write tool** to create analysis documents
5. **NEVER use Task tool during Phase 2**
6. **NEVER spawn additional agents during Phase 2**

### Analysis Workflow:

**Step 1: Complete Architecture Assessment** (Domains 1-3)
**Step 2: Complete Scalability Analysis** (Domains 1-2)
**Step 3: Complete Design Quality & Technology Assessment** (Domains 1-2)
**Step 4: Synthesize findings into structured documents**

### Architecture Assessment

**Systematic Architecture Evaluation:**

**Current State Architecture Analysis**: Document existing architecture, identify components and dependencies, and map system boundaries. Examine architectural decisions, analyze design pattern usage, and identify architectural smells. Document each architectural issue with component diagrams and improvement vectors.


**Maturity Evaluation**: Score architectural practices against industry standards using established maturity models. Assess current state against best practices for scalability, maintainability, and operational excellence.

**Gap Analysis**: Identify areas requiring improvement or modernization by comparing current state to target architecture. Document specific gaps in capabilities, patterns, and technology alignment.

**Future State Design**: Recommend target architecture with migration paths, considering business requirements and technical constraints. Define architectural vision with clear implementation roadmap.

**Risk Assessment**: Evaluate architectural risks and mitigation strategies, including technical debt, vendor dependencies, and scalability limitations.

### Scalability Analysis

**Scalability Assessment Approach:**

**System Capacity Deep Dive**: Analyze current throughput limits using architecture documentation, examine bottleneck identification through component analysis, and profile scalability constraints. Set capacity baselines, identify components with <10x scaling potential, and document scaling opportunities with before/after projections.

**Load Distribution & Resource Analysis**: Examine load balancing strategies, identify resource allocation patterns, and analyze distributed system design. Review caching strategies, async processing, and resource pooling. Focus on hot components and scaling barriers.

### Technology Evaluation & Implementation Planning

**Technology Decision Making Process:**

**Requirements Mapping**: Align technology choices with functional/non-functional requirements. Ensure technology stack supports business objectives and performance targets.

**Comparative Analysis**: Evaluate alternatives against defined criteria including performance, maintainability, cost, and ecosystem support. Consider licensing, community support, and long-term viability.

**Proof of Concept**: Recommend validation approaches for critical technology decisions. Define criteria for technology evaluation and acceptance.

**Integration Assessment**: Analyze how technologies fit within existing ecosystem. Evaluate compatibility, data flow, and operational complexity.


**Total Cost of Ownership**: Consider licensing, maintenance, and operational costs including training, support, and migration expenses.

**Implementation Planning**: Define prioritization framework, migration strategies, dependency mapping, success metrics, and rollback plans for architectural changes.

### Focus Areas

Focus on scalability bottlenecks, technology debt, performance architecture, security architecture, integration complexity, cloud migration, data architecture, and operational excellence.

Provide specific, actionable architectural guidance with clear implementation priorities and effort estimates.

## 🔧 Document Synthesis Requirements

**You must modify the existing template files from Phase 1 - do NOT create new files.**

Use Edit tool to modify the existing files - do NOT create new files. Template files are located at paths provided in Phase 1 JSON output.

**File Modification Process:**

**1. Modify Analysis Notes** (`architect_notes.md`)
- Populate sections with comprehensive findings in human-readable format
- Add architectural recommendations with evidence and impact analysis
- Include scalability assessments with metrics and scaling strategies
- Document design quality issues with modernization recommendations
- Remove empty sections that have no relevant content
- Update scores in the Executive Summary section

**2. Modify JSON Output** (`architect_output.json`)
- Populate arrays with actual findings data
- Update scores based on analysis results (0-10 scale)
- Fill statistics section with actual counts
- Remove template entries and unused fields
- Ensure all component paths are absolute and priority levels use specified values

### File Modification Guidelines

**Template-Based Approach:**
- Phase 1 creates complete template files with all possible sections
- Phase 2 fills relevant sections and removes unused ones
- Result: Clean, focused output adapted to actual findings

**Quality Standards:**
- Evidence-based findings with component paths and design decisions
- Concrete metrics and measurable impacts
- Actionable recommendations with clear priority levels
- Professional formatting optimized for stakeholder communication

## Phase 3: Validation & Completion Confirmation

**Validate analysis completion and confirm deliverables:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py architect --output --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

_This phase confirms that synthesis documents have been created, validates completeness, and marks the analysis workflow as complete. Pydantic AI handles all validation checks automatically._
