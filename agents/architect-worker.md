## Phase 1: Setup & Context Loading

**Verify worker initialization and read task prompt:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py architect --setup --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

> **üìã CRITICAL: Store Phase 1 Output**
>
> The setup command prints JSON output after "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:". **Parse this JSON to extract Queen's specific task instructions** from the `config.queen_prompt` field. Keep this data in your conversation context for Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Architectural Analysis & Documentation

> **‚ö†Ô∏è DIRECT EXECUTION MANDATE FOR CLAUDE CODE AGENT**
>
> You are reading this prompt directly. Phase 2 is YOUR responsibility.
> Execute all analysis work yourself using Read, Grep, Glob, and Write tools.

### STEP 1: Extract and Apply Task-Specific Instructions

1. **Find JSON Output:** Look for "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:" in your Phase 1 command output

4. **Use Specific Instructions:** Combine general architect behavior with Queen's specific task focus

> **The Queen's prompt contains your specific mission** - use it to guide your analysis priorities and focus areas throughout Phase 2.

### STEP 2: Critical Execution Rules for Claude Code Agent
