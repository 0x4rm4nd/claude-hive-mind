‚ùå Areas for Improvement (Minor Issues)

1. CLI Inconsistency (Score: 7/10)

Issue: Queen still uses subprocess calls instead of direct BaseWorker integration:

# Current - Inconsistent:

def run_queen(args):
cmd = [sys.executable, queen_runner, "--session", args.session]
return subprocess.run(cmd)

# Should be - Consistent:

def run_queen(args):
worker = QueenWorker()
return worker.run_cli_main()

2. Model Selection Strategy (Score: 8/10)

- Missing intelligent model routing based on task complexity
- No fallback handling for model availability issues
- Queen uses o3-mini, others use gpt-5 - inconsistent strategy

3. Documentation Gaps (Score: 8.5/10)

- Missing integration examples showing worker coordination
- No troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Performance benchmarks not documented

Unique Innovations

1. Runtime Config Resolution: Solved the static config empty values problem elegantly
2. Dual-Mode Agents: Scribe's create/synthesis modes within BaseWorker framework
3. Strategic Tools: Queen's @tool decorators for intelligent decision-making
4. Event Sourcing: Clean elimination of STATE.json in favor of event streams

Production Readiness
