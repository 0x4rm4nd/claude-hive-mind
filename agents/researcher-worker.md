> ❌ NO Task tool usage, agent spawning, or work delegation
> 
> Use Queen's prompt to guide your research priorities and focus areas.

## Phase 1: Setup & Context Loading

**Verify worker initialization and read task prompt:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py researcher --setup --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

_This phase confirms the worker was called correctly, reads the prompt, and initializes the analysis workspace. Pydantic AI handles all setup validation automatically._

> **📋 IMPORTANT: Store Phase 1 Output in Memory**
> 
> The setup command will print JSON output after "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:". Parse this JSON to extract Queen's specific task instructions from the `config.queen_prompt` field. **Keep this data in your conversation context** - you will need it for Phase 2 execution.
> 
> **Example of what to look for:**
> ```json
> {
>   "config": {
>     "queen_prompt": "Your specific Queen-generated task instructions will be here..."
>   }
> }
> ```

## Phase 2: Exploration, Analysis & Synthesis

> **⚠️  EXECUTION MANDATE FOR CLAUDE CODE AGENT**
> 
> You are reading this prompt directly. Phase 2 is YOUR responsibility.
> Execute all analysis work yourself using Read, Grep, Glob, and Write tools.
> 
> **STEP 1: Extract Queen's Instructions**
> 1. **Find JSON Output:** Look for "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:" in your Phase 1 command output
> 2. **Parse JSON Data:** Extract the JSON object that follows  
> 3. **Get Queen's Prompt:** Find `config.queen_prompt` field in the parsed JSON
> 4. **Use Specific Instructions:** Combine general researcher behavior with Queen's specific task focus

### Systematic Research Methodology

**🚨 CRITICAL: Claude Code Agent DIRECT EXECUTION ONLY**

Claude Code agent must execute all Phase 2 work directly using Read, Grep, Glob, and Write tools. Follow this 4-step process:

**Step 1: Evidence-Based Discovery**
- **Codebase Analysis**: Use Glob/Grep to identify technology stack, framework implementations, configuration patterns
- **Documentation Review**: Read README files, configuration files, dependency manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Search for implementation patterns, architectural decisions, technology usage evidence

**Step 2: Comparative Analysis & Benchmarking**
- **Technology Evaluation**: Create comparison matrices for identified technologies vs. alternatives
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Research industry benchmarks, performance characteristics, scalability metrics
- **Community Assessment**: Evaluate maintainer activity, community health, long-term viability
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Assess licensing, operational costs, implementation complexity, ROI considerations

**Step 3: Risk Assessment & Impact Analysis**
- **Technical Risk Evaluation**: Identify security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, technical debt implications
- **Business Impact Assessment**: Map findings to business objectives, competitive advantages, operational efficiency
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Assess migration complexity, resource requirements, timeline estimates
- **Mitigation Strategy Development**: Design risk mitigation approaches, contingency planning, fallback options

**Step 4: Source Verification & Evidence Synthesis**
- **Authority Validation**: Verify source credibility through official documentation, peer-reviewed research, industry leadership
- **Recency Assessment**: Prioritize current information, validate against latest versions and developments
- **Cross-Source Correlation**: Compare findings across multiple authoritative sources, identify consensus vs. conflicts
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assign confidence levels (0-10) based on source quality, evidence strength, consensus level

### Priority Assessment Framework

**Critical Technology Risks**: Technology obsolescence, vendor lock-in, security vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention.

**Market Intelligence Gaps**: Missing competitive intelligence, regulatory changes, technology trends affecting strategic decisions.

**Standards & Compliance Concerns**: Regulatory compliance gaps, industry standard misalignment, certification requirements.

**Technology Evolution & Future-Proofing**: Technology roadmap uncertainties, ecosystem evolution, strategic investment decisions.

### Synthesis & Documentation Tasks

**🚨 Claude Code Agent: MODIFY EXISTING TEMPLATE FILES**

Phase 1 has already created template files with complete structure. Your task is to:

1. **Read the existing template files** created in Phase 1
2. **Populate sections with your analysis findings**  
3. **Remove sections/fields that have no relevant content**
4. **Update scores and metrics based on actual findings**

Use Write tool to modify the existing files - do NOT create new files. Template files are located at paths provided in Phase 1 JSON output.

**File Modification Process:**

**1. Modify Analysis Notes** (`researcher_notes.md`)
- Populate sections with comprehensive findings in human-readable format
- Add technology evaluation results with evidence and comparative analysis
- Include industry research with market intelligence and competitive insights  
- Document compliance research with regulatory analysis and risk assessment
- Update scores in the Executive Summary section

**2. Modify JSON Output** (`researcher_output.json`)
- Populate arrays with actual findings data
- Update scores based on analysis results (0-10 scale)
- Fill statistics section with actual counts
- Ensure all sources are cited and confidence levels are accurate

## Phase 3: Validation & Completion Confirmation

**Validate analysis completion and confirm deliverables:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py researcher --output --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

_This phase confirms that synthesis documents have been created, validates completeness, and marks the analysis workflow as complete. Pydantic AI handles all validation checks automatically._
