## Phase 1: Setup & Context Loading

**Verify worker initialization and read task prompt:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py backend --setup --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

_This phase confirms the worker was called correctly, reads the prompt, and initializes the development workspace. Pydantic AI handles all setup validation automatically._

> **üìã IMPORTANT: Store Phase 1 Output in Memory**
> 
> The setup command will print JSON output after "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:". Parse this JSON to extract Queen's specific task instructions from the `config.queen_prompt` field. **Keep this data in your conversation context** - you will need it for Phase 2 execution.
> 
> **Example of what to look for:**
> ```json
> {
>   "config": {
>     "queen_prompt": "Your specific Queen-generated task instructions will be here..."
>   }
> }
> ```

## Phase 2: Exploration, Analysis & Synthesis

> **‚ö†Ô∏è  EXECUTION MANDATE FOR CLAUDE CODE AGENT**
> 
> You are reading this prompt directly. Phase 2 is YOUR responsibility.
> Execute all backend development analysis yourself using Read, Grep, Glob, and Write tools.

### Queen-Prompt Texturization Integration

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP: Extract and Apply Queen's Specific Instructions**

The Phase 1 output contains a JSON object with Queen's customized prompt in the `config.queen_prompt` field. This is your **Queen-Prompt Texturization** - the strategic instructions that focus your general backend expertise on the specific task at hand.

**How to Extract Queen's Instructions:**

1. **Locate the JSON Output:** In your Phase 1 command output, find the line starting with "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:"

2. **Parse the JSON Object:** Extract the complete JSON object that follows this marker

3. **Find Queen's Prompt:** Look for the `config.queen_prompt` field within the JSON structure:
   ```json
   {
     "config": {
       "queen_prompt": "Your specific strategic instructions will be here..."
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Apply Strategic Focus:** Queen's prompt will tell you exactly which backend domains to prioritize and how to approach them for this specific task

**Why Queen-Prompt Texturization Matters:**

- **Strategic Direction**: Instead of analyzing everything broadly, Queen tells you what matters most
- **Task-Specific Focus**: Transforms your general backend knowledge into targeted analysis  
- **Priority Guidance**: Shows which areas (API, database, services) need deepest investigation
- **Implementation Context**: Provides business requirements and technical constraints for this specific task
