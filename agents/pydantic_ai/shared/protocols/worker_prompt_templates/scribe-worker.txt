You are performing Phase 2 of a 3-Phase Creative Synthesis for session: {session_id}

## Your Mission:
Perform creative, semantic analysis of all worker outputs to create a comprehensive architectural synthesis that goes beyond programmatic pattern matching.

## Available Worker Analysis Files:
{file_paths_str}

## Worker Count: {worker_count} specialized workers completed analysis

## Your Creative Analysis Tasks:

### 1. **Cross-Domain Relationship Analysis**
- Identify conflicts between worker recommendations
- Find synergies and implementation dependencies
- Prioritize competing approaches (security vs performance)
- Map cross-service impacts (architecture → DevOps)

### 2. **Strategic Insight Generation**
- Create implementation roadmaps with dependency ordering
- Identify critical path optimizations
- Synthesize conflicting approaches into coherent strategy
- Generate insights beyond individual worker scope

### 3. **Semantic Understanding**
- Extract true intent behind recommendations
- Identify underlying architectural patterns
- Connect technical issues to business impact
- Create actionable priority frameworks

## Template Structure Reference:
The template contains these sections - enrich each with your creative analysis:
- 📊 **Executive Summary**: Your strategic assessment across all domains
- 🚨 **Critical Issues**: Prioritized by impact and dependencies using framework below
- 🏆 **Architectural Strengths**: Patterns worth preserving/extending
- ⚡ **Performance Analysis**: Bottlenecks, optimizations, and scaling strategies
- 🔧 **Infrastructure Assessment**: DevOps, deployment, and operational concerns
- 📈 **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach with dependencies and timelines
- 🔍 **Cross-Domain Integration**: How changes affect multiple areas
- 📊 **Risk Assessment**: Technical, business, and operational risks with mitigation

## Priority Classification Framework:
- **CRITICAL** (0-24 hours): Security vulnerabilities, system failures, data exposure
- **HIGH** (1-2 weeks): Performance bottlenecks, scalability blockers, reliability issues
- **MEDIUM** (2-4 weeks): Architecture improvements, code quality, technical debt
- **LOW** (1-3 months): Nice-to-have optimizations, future enhancements, refactoring

## Output Requirements:

Create a comprehensive SYNTHESIS.md file at: {session_path}/SYNTHESIS.md

## Success Criteria:
- ✅ No template placeholders remain (check for {{}}, TODO, TBD, etc.)
- ✅ Strategic insights connect multiple worker domains with cross-references
- ✅ Implementation plan accounts for dependencies and blocking relationships
- ✅ Business impact clearly articulated with cost/benefit analysis
- ✅ Actionable recommendations with effort estimates and resource requirements
- ✅ Minimum 2000 words demonstrating thorough analysis and deep insights
- ✅ Each recommendation includes specific file references and line numbers where applicable
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies provided for all CRITICAL and HIGH priority issues
- ✅ Implementation timeline with milestone dependencies clearly mapped

Read all worker files comprehensively and create synthesis that demonstrates deep understanding of the architectural landscape.
