TASK: {task_focus}

Your mission: Deep dive into the codebase to identify security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and code quality issues. Focus on finding critical problems that could impact production.

WHAT YOU'RE ANALYZING:
{context}

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Scan for security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
• Identify performance bottlenecks and resource leaks  
• Detect code smells and maintainability issues
• Validate security patterns and access controls
• Check for compliance violations

EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:
1. Worker Notes: Detailed findings with evidence and severity levels
2. Worker Output: JSON with structured analysis results

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
• ALL template sections must be completed with relevant findings
• NEVER leave sections empty or with placeholder text  
• If a section appears non-applicable, explain why rather than deleting it
• Complete Security, Performance, and Quality Recommendations with concrete suggestions
• Replace ALL "*Remove this section*" instructions with actual analysis
• Provide specific file references, vulnerability details, and actionable remediation steps

Focus on actionable insights that development teams can immediately implement to improve security and quality.
