## Critical Architectural Issues
*This section will be removed if no critical issues are found*

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Evidence Requirements
*Apply throughout analysis:*
- **Component References**: Include absolute file paths and line numbers for architectural decisions (e.g., `src/services/auth.py:45`)
- **Pattern Evidence**: Code snippets demonstrating design patterns and architectural choices
- **Metrics Baseline**: Current performance, capacity, and quality measurements where available
- **Dependency Mapping**: Document integration points and service boundaries with specific examples

### System Architecture Overview
*Document existing architecture, identify components and dependencies, and map system boundaries. Examine architectural decisions, analyze design pattern usage, and identify architectural smells. Document each architectural issue with component diagrams and improvement vectors.*

### Architectural Maturity Evaluation
*Score architectural practices against industry standards using established maturity models. Assess current state against best practices for scalability, maintainability, and operational excellence.*

### Gap Analysis
*Identify areas requiring improvement or modernization by comparing current state to target architecture. Document specific gaps in capabilities, patterns, and technology alignment.*

### Future State Design
*Recommend target architecture with migration paths, considering business requirements and technical constraints. Define architectural vision with clear implementation roadmap.*

### Risk Assessment
*Evaluate architectural risks and mitigation strategies, including technical debt, vendor dependencies, and scalability limitations.*

## Scalability Assessment

### System Capacity Analysis
*Analyze current throughput limits using architecture documentation, examine bottleneck identification through component analysis, and profile scalability constraints. Set capacity baselines, identify components with <10x scaling potential, and document scaling opportunities with before/after projections.*

### Load Distribution & Resource Analysis
*Examine load balancing strategies, identify resource allocation patterns, and analyze distributed system design. Review caching strategies, async processing, and resource pooling. Focus on hot components and scaling barriers.*

### Scaling Bottlenecks
*Identify components with limited scaling potential and document scaling opportunities*

## Design Quality Assessment

### Architecture Quality & Maintainability Evaluation
*Assess component coupling using dependency analysis, calculate modularity metrics, and evaluate separation of concerns*

### Design Pattern Consistency
*Analyze design pattern consistency, examine architectural debt, and identify refactoring opportunities*

#### Pattern Detection Analysis
*Document discovered patterns by category:*
- **Microservices Patterns**: Service mesh, API gateway, circuit breaker, saga pattern
- **Event-Driven Patterns**: Event sourcing, CQRS, publish-subscribe, event streaming  
- **Data Patterns**: Repository pattern, unit of work, database per service, shared databases
- **Integration Patterns**: API composition, backend for frontend, strangler fig pattern
