## Phase 1: Setup & Context Loading

**Verify worker initialization and read task prompt:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py designer --setup --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

_This phase confirms the worker was called correctly, reads the prompt, and initializes the design analysis workspace. Pydantic AI handles all setup validation automatically._

> **📋 IMPORTANT: Store Phase 1 Output in Memory**
> 
> The setup command will print JSON output after "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:". Parse this JSON to extract Queen's specific task instructions from the `config.queen_prompt` field. **Keep this data in your conversation context** - you will need it for Phase 2 execution.
> 
> **Example of what to look for:**
> ```json
> {
>   "config": {
>     "queen_prompt": "Your specific Queen-generated task instructions will be here..."
>   }
> }
> ```

## Phase 2: Exploration, Analysis & Synthesis

> **⚠️  EXECUTION MANDATE FOR CLAUDE CODE AGENT**
> 
> You are reading this prompt directly. Phase 2 is YOUR responsibility.
> Execute all design analysis work yourself using Read, Grep, Glob, and Write tools.
> 
> **STEP 1: Extract Queen's Instructions**
> 1. **Find JSON Output:** Look for "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:" in your Phase 1 command output
> 2. **Parse JSON Data:** Extract the JSON object that follows  
> 3. **Get Queen's Prompt:** Find `config.queen_prompt` field in the parsed JSON
> 4. **Use Specific Instructions:** Combine general designer behavior with Queen's specific task focus
> 
> **STEP 2: Execute Direct Analysis**
> - ✅ Direct code examination with Read/Grep/Glob tools
> - ✅ Direct file creation with Write tool  
> - ✅ Complete design analysis workflow execution
> - ❌ NO Task tool usage, agent spawning, or work delegation
> 
> The Queen's prompt contains your specific mission - use it to guide your design analysis priorities and focus areas.

### Core Work Phase - Structured Workflow

**🚨 CRITICAL: Claude Code Agent DIRECT EXECUTION ONLY**

**DO NOT use Task tool. DO NOT spawn agents. DO NOT delegate.**

Claude Code agent must execute all Phase 2 work directly using Read, Grep, Glob, and Write tools. Follow this structured workflow:

### Execution Rules for Claude Code Agent:

1. **Use Read tool** to examine UI components, stylesheets, and design files
2. **Use Grep tool** to search for design patterns and accessibility attributes  
3. **Use Glob tool** to find relevant design and component files across the codebase
4. **Use Write tool** to create design analysis documents
5. **NEVER use Task tool during Phase 2**
6. **NEVER spawn additional agents during Phase 2**

### Design Analysis Workflow:

**Step 1: Complete Systematic Design Audit Process** (Design Patterns → Usability Heuristics → Accessibility Compliance)
**Step 2: Complete UX Design Analysis** (User Journey + Information Architecture + Interaction Design)
**Step 3: Complete UI Design Analysis** (Design System Consistency + Typography + Responsive Design)
**Step 4: Complete Accessibility & Inclusive Design Assessment** (WCAG Compliance + Assistive Technology Support)  
**Step 5: Complete Design Debt Assessment** (System violations + Pattern inconsistencies + Refactoring opportunities)
**Step 6: Synthesize findings with cross-domain correlation analysis into structured documents**

- **Performance-Design Impact**: Visual complexity decisions affecting bundle size and rendering performance  
- **Backend-Design Alignment**: API response patterns affecting loading states and error handling UX

### Synthesis & Documentation Tasks

**🚨 Claude Code Agent: MODIFY EXISTING TEMPLATE FILES**

Phase 1 has already created template files with complete structure. Your task is to:

1. **Read the existing template files** created in Phase 1
2. **Populate sections with your design analysis findings**  
3. **Remove sections/fields that have no relevant content**
4. **Update scores and metrics based on actual findings**

Use Edit tool to modify the existing files - do NOT create new files. Template files are located at paths provided in Phase 1 JSON output.

**File Modification Process:**

**1. Modify Design Analysis Notes** (`designer_notes.md`)
- Populate sections with comprehensive findings in human-readable format
- Add UX issues with evidence and user impact analysis
- Include UI design inconsistencies with metrics and brand alignment strategies  
- Document accessibility violations with WCAG compliance and remediation recommendations
- Remove empty sections that have no relevant content
- Update scores in the Executive Summary section

**2. Modify JSON Output** (`designer_output.json`)
- Populate arrays with actual design findings data
- Update scores based on analysis results (0-10 scale)
- Fill statistics section with actual counts
- Remove template entries and unused fields
- Ensure all file paths are absolute and severity levels use specified values

### File Modification Guidelines
