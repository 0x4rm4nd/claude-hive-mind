## Phase 1: Setup & Context Loading

**Verify worker initialization and read task prompt:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py designer --setup --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

_This phase confirms the worker was called correctly, reads the prompt, and initializes the design analysis workspace. Pydantic AI handles all setup validation automatically._

> **📋 IMPORTANT: Store Phase 1 Output in Memory**
> 
> The setup command will print JSON output after "WORKER_OUTPUT_JSON:". Parse this JSON to extract Queen's specific task instructions from the `config.queen_prompt` field. **Keep this data in your conversation context** - you will need it for Phase 2 execution.
> 
> **Example of what to look for:**
> ```json
> {
>   "config": {
>     "queen_prompt": "Your specific Queen-generated task instructions will be here..."
>   }
> }
> ```

### Execution Rules & Structured Workflow

**🚨 CRITICAL: Claude Code Agent DIRECT EXECUTION ONLY**

**DO NOT use Task tool. DO NOT spawn agents. DO NOT delegate.**

**Tool Usage:** Read (UI components, stylesheets, design files) → Grep (design patterns, accessibility attributes) → Glob (component files across codebase) → Write (analysis documents)

**6-Step Analysis Workflow:**
1. **Systematic Design Audit** (Patterns → Heuristics → Accessibility)
2. **UX Analysis** (User Journey + Information Architecture + Interactions)
3. **UI Analysis** (Design System + Typography + Responsive)
4. **Accessibility Assessment** (WCAG + Assistive Technology)
5. **Design Debt Analysis** (System violations + Pattern inconsistencies)
6. **Cross-Domain Synthesis** (Correlate findings into structured documents)

### Analysis Focus Areas

**UX Design Analysis:**
- **User Journey & Flow**: Map user flows, navigation paths, interaction patterns, usability bottlenecks with evidence
- **Information Architecture**: Evaluate navigation structures, content hierarchies, wayfinding systems, access patterns
- **Interaction Design**: Review interaction patterns, consistency models, error handling, feedback systems, task flows
- **User Research Integration**: Analyze persona utilization, user testing integration, validation approaches

**UI Design Analysis:**
- **Design System Consistency**: Component consistency using design tokens, brand adherence, visual hierarchy, standardization metrics
- **Typography & Visual Hierarchy**: Typography systems, color patterns, layout grids, spacing consistency, visual balance
- **Responsive Design**: Breakpoint behavior, mobile optimization, touch targets, cross-device consistency, mobile usability

**Accessibility & Inclusive Design:**
- **WCAG Compliance**: Measure compliance using WCAG 2.1 AA (scoring thresholds), assistive technology compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Assistive Technology Support**: Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver), keyboard navigation, focus management, alternative content provision

**Design Debt Assessment:**
- **Systematic Analysis**: Component audit with deviation metrics, design system violations, visual inconsistency quantification, refactoring priorities (0-10 scale)
- **Technical Debt Correlation**: Map design inconsistencies to development velocity impacts and maintenance overhead

### Evidence & Documentation Standards

**Cross-Domain Analysis**: Correlate UX findings with UI inconsistencies, accessibility violations, and design debt. Examples: Poor navigation + inadequate contrast + system violations = compound risk

**Evidence Requirements:**
- **Code Snippets**: File paths (`/src/components/Modal.tsx:67`), line numbers, design pattern references
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed UX/accessibility issue reproduction with user scenarios, browser/device specs
- **Impact Quantification**: Specific metrics (task completion: 45s→30s, WCAG compliance: 85%→95%, consistency: 6/10→8/10)
- **Implementation Estimates**: Time/complexity with dependency analysis (4-8 hours, medium effort, affects 12 components)
- **Risk Assessment**: Severity scoring (DESIGNER-CRIT-001), user impact %, business impact correlation

**Priority Assessment Framework:**
- **DESIGNER-CRIT**: Navigation failures, accessibility violations blocking access, system violations >50% components
- **DESIGNER-HIGH**: Visual inconsistencies with measurable impact, responsive failures >30% mobile users
- **DESIGNER-MED**: System compliance gaps <30% components, accessibility testing risks, pattern inconsistencies
- **DESIGNER-LOW**: Performance optimization opportunities, enhanced validation integration


### Synthesis & Documentation

**🚨 Claude Code Agent: MODIFY EXISTING TEMPLATE FILES**

Phase 1 created template files. Your task:
1. **Read existing template files** from Phase 1
2. **Populate sections** with design analysis findings
3. **Remove empty sections** with no relevant content
4. **Update scores/metrics** based on actual findings

Use Edit tool to modify existing files - do NOT create new ones. Template paths in Phase 1 JSON output.

**File Modification:**
- **designer_notes.md**: Comprehensive findings, UX issues with evidence, UI inconsistencies with metrics, accessibility violations with WCAG compliance
- **designer_output.json**: Populate arrays with findings data, update scores (0-10), fill statistics, remove template entries

**Quality Standards**: Evidence-based findings with file paths, concrete metrics, actionable recommendations, professional formatting

## Phase 3: Validation & Completion Confirmation

**Validate design analysis completion and confirm deliverables:**

```bash
cd .claude/agents/pydantic_ai/
python cli.py designer --output --session ${SESSION_ID} --model custom:max-subscription
```

_This phase confirms that synthesis documents have been created, validates completeness, and marks the design analysis workflow as complete. Pydantic AI handles all validation checks automatically._
