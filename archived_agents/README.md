# Archived Claude Code Agents

> **These agents represent the previous instruction-dependent paradigm and are kept for reference only.**

## ⚠️ Migration Status

**All agents in this directory have been superseded by the framework-enforced Pydantic AI implementations in `../pydantic/`.**

### **Archived Agents:**

- **`queen-orchestrator.md`** → **`../pydantic/queen/`**
  - **Before**: 500+ lines of markdown instructions, manual protocol compliance
  - **After**: Code-enforced behavior, automatic validation, continuous monitoring
  - **Migration Date**: August 2025
  - **Reason**: Framework-enforced reliability vs instruction-dependent behavior

## 🔄 Paradigm Evolution

| Aspect | Archived (Instruction-Based) | Active (Framework-Enforced) |
|--------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Behavior** | 📝 "Please remember to..." | 🏗️ Structurally impossible to skip |
| **Validation** | ❌ Can return anything | ✅ Pydantic schema required |
| **Reliability** | 🎲 Probabilistic compliance | 🔒 Deterministic execution |
| **Debugging** | 😵‍💫 "Why didn't it follow?" | 🔍 Python stack traces |

## 📚 Reference Value

These archived files serve as:
- **Historical Documentation**: Original orchestration requirements and domain knowledge
- **Migration Reference**: Understanding what functionality was converted to code
- **Architectural Evolution**: Demonstrating the shift from instruction-dependent to framework-enforced AI

**Active Implementation**: Use `../pydantic/` for all current agent functionality.
