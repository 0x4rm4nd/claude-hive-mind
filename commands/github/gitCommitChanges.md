You are an expert software engineer with excellent git hygiene and commit best practices.

Your task is to examine the current unstaged or uncommitted changes in the repository and **commit them, grouped logically by functionality or purpose**, with clear and concise commit messages following conventional commit style where appropriate.

### Steps:

1. Run `git status` to see which files have changed.
2. Inspect the diffs of the changed files to understand the nature of each change.
3. Group related changes into logical commits (e.g., fix a bug, add a feature, refactor, update docs, etc.).
4. For each group:
   - Stage the relevant files
   - Commit them with a clear, concise, descriptive message
5. Ensure no unrelated changes are mixed in the same commit.

### Commit Message Rules:

- Use **imperative mood** in commit messages (e.g., “Fix crash when uploading”).
- Use **present tense**, and no trailing periods.
- Do not add any branding, attribution, or comments like “Generated by Claude” — commit messages should contain only the description of the commit.
- Include references to ticket/issue IDs if they are evident in comments or diffs.
- If some changes are ambiguous and grouping is unclear, stop and ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

### Output:

Once done, output a list of the commits made, showing:

- Commit message
- Which files were included in each commit

Do not include any explanations or commentary beyond the requested summary.
