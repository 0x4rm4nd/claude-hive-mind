## üöÄ Enhanced Coordination System

### Dynamic Escalation System with Cross-Worker Coordination
**Decision**: Dynamic escalation timeouts based on task urgency + domain complexity with peer-to-peer escalation before hierarchical escalation
**Rationale**: 50-60% multi-worker tasks need real-time coordination; escalation chains should adapt to actual blocker severity and worker availability
**Dynamic Timeout Formula**:
- **Base Timeout**: Complexity level (2min critical, 5min high, 10min medium, 15min low)
- **Urgency Multiplier**: Critical issues (0.5x), blocking multiple workers (0.3x), individual blockers (1x)
- **Domain Factor**: Security/performance issues (0.7x), UI/UX issues (1.2x), research blockers (1.5x)

**Escalation Hierarchy**:
1. **Peer Cross-Escalation** (First): frontend ‚Üî backend, analyzer ‚Üî architect, test ‚Üî devops
2. **Domain Escalation** (Second): Vertical escalation to domain experts (analyzer-worker, service-architect)
3. **Queen Intervention** (Final): Complex coordination and resolution decisions

**Failure Handling**: 
- **Unavailable Escalation Target**: Worker completes all possible work, marks status as "blocked_done", Queen handles resolution
- **Chain Failure Recovery**: Queen checks blocked tasks on respawn, resolves issues, re-spawns blocked workers
- **Alternative Work**: Blocked workers shift to non-dependent tasks while awaiting resolution

**Impact**: 40-60% reduction in coordination delays with intelligent escalation routing and robust failure recovery

### Tag-Based Memory Bank & Context Isolation  
**Decision**: Inline tag system with programmatic worker context filtering 
**Rationale**: 60-80% token efficiency while maintaining cross-domain coordination capability
**Implementation**: Workers see only relevant memory bank sections + strategic cross-domain access

### Enhanced Archive & Reflection System
**Decision**: Systematic knowledge capture with automatic pattern extraction
**Rationale**: Convert session learnings into reusable patterns for future tasks
**Implementation**: Tag-integrated learning pipeline from sessions to memory bank

## üéØ Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Pydantic AI Framework-Enforced Architecture
**Decision**: Migrated from instruction-based markdown workers to framework-enforced Pydantic AI agents
**Rationale**: Eliminate human error in protocol compliance by making violations structurally impossible
**Architecture Pattern**:
- **Framework-Enforced**: Critical behaviors (logging, file creation, validation) are code-enforced via Pydantic schemas
- **Creative LLM**: Strategic reasoning, content generation, and analysis remain flexible for AI intelligence
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Multiple Pydantic AI agents coordinate through STATE.json for complex tasks

**Agent Types (Framework-Enforced)**:
- üèóÔ∏è **Agent-Architect**: Meta-system designer specializing in Pydantic AI framework patterns and ecosystem architecture
- üî¨ **Researcher Agents**: Context7-integrated research with validated output schemas
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Backend Agents**: API/database specialists with type-safe implementation patterns
- üé® **Frontend Agents**: UI/client-side specialists with component architecture validation
- üéØ **Designer Agents**: UX/UI design with structured design system compliance
- üß™ **Test Agents**: Quality assurance with comprehensive testing strategy validation
- üöÄ **DevOps Agents**: Infrastructure specialists with deployment pipeline validation
- üîç **Analyzer Agents**: Security, performance, and code quality assessment with structured findings
- üëë **Queen-Orchestrator Agent**: Multi-agent coordination with STATE.json management

**Key Improvement**: From "hoping they follow instructions" to "structurally impossible to get wrong"

### 2. Research-First Protocol Necessity
**Decision**: Always do full research with adaptive depth based on task type
**Rationale**: 
- Software development requires staying current with latest libraries and best practices
- Context7 provides access to most recent documentation and code examples
- Research prevents technical debt from outdated or suboptimal choices
- Ensures security and performance considerations are evaluated upfront

**Research Depth Scaling**:
- **New Features**: Comprehensive Context7 + Serena analysis + cross-worker synthesis
- **Bug Fixes**: Quick lookup + existing pattern analysis
- **Maintenance**: Pattern library + minimal external research

### 3. Framework-Enforced Protocol System with Code Integration
**Decision**: Migrate from markdown protocols to Python module protocols in `.claude/agents/pydantic_ai/shared/protocols/`
**Rationale**:
- **Code-Enforced Compliance**: Protocols are Python functions that cannot be skipped or violated
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure protocol inputs/outputs are structurally valid
- **Tool Integration**: Context7 MCP and Serena MCP integrate directly with protocol functions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Built-in fallbacks when external tools unavailable
- **Self-Contained**: System operates independently with enhanced functionality when tools available

**Protocol Architecture**:
```python
# Framework-enforced protocol system
from protocols import (
    SessionManagement,      # session_management.py
    LoggingProtocol,       # logging_protocol.py  
    WorkerPromptProtocol,  # worker_prompt_protocol.py
    PromptGenerator,       # prompt_generator.py
    ProtocolLoader,        # protocol_loader.py
    EnvLoader             # env_loader.py
)

# Automatic protocol enforcement - cannot be bypassed
def run_pydantic_agent(agent_config: AgentConfig, task: str):
    # Framework enforces protocol compliance
    session = SessionManagement.initialize_session(agent_config.session_id)
    LoggingProtocol.log_event("agent_started", agent_config.name)
    
    # AI reasoning within validated structure
    result = agent.run_sync(task, model=agent_config.model)
    
    # Framework validates output structure
    validated_output = AgentOutput.model_validate(result.output)
    return validated_output
```

### 4. Session Complexity & Resumption Requirements
**Decision**: Full session resumption capability is mandatory for all software development
**Rationale**:
- Software development sessions often span multiple days or interruptions
- Research findings must be preserved across sessions to avoid duplicate work
- Worker coordination state must be exactly restored for complex multi-worker tasks
- Progress tracking essential for understanding project history and decisions made

**Session Scope**: Software development only - used for tracking implementation history and coordination

**Session State Components**:
- **STATE.json**: Machine-readable resumption data with worker coordination state
- **SESSION.md**: Human-readable summary for historical context and project documentation
- **EVENTS.jsonl**: Complete coordination history for worker synchronization and resumption
- **Worker Notes**: Individual worker context, research findings, and decision rationale

---

## üìä File Architecture Rationale

### Multi-File Coordination System with Enforcement
**Decision**: Maintain separate EVENTS.jsonl + BACKLOG.jsonl + SESSION.md + STATE.json files with enforcement mechanisms
**Rationale**: Each serves distinct purposes with STATE.json as the enforcement controller

#### STATE.json - Worker Configuration & State
```json
{"coordination_status": {"worker_configs": {"backend-worker": {"status": "not_started", "task_id": "local_task_001", "tag_access": ["backend"]}}}}
```
**Purpose**:
- Single source of truth for session state.
- Contains worker-specific configurations under `coordination_status.worker_configs`, including task assignments, permissions, and protocols.
- Tracks the real-time status of all workers and the overall session phase.
- Workers MUST read this file on startup to get their configuration.

#### EVENTS.jsonl - Machine-Readable Coordination with Mandatory Monitoring
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-01-15T15:00:00Z", "type": "notification", "event": "worker_blocking", "agent": "frontend-worker", "target": "backend-worker", "data": {"message": "Waiting for API endpoints specification", "priority": "high", "estimated_delay": "4 hours"}}
```
**Purpose**:
- Real-time worker blocking/unblocking notifications for any development scenario
- Machine-parseable for automated coordination and session resumption
- Priority-based task reprioritization triggers (2min critical, 5min high, 10min medium, 15min low)
- Complete event history for understanding project progression
- **MANDATORY**: Workers MUST check every 2-3 minutes for coordination events

#### BACKLOG.jsonl - Local Task Buffer
```json
{"id": "task-001", "title": "Implement user authentication", "status": "completed", "deliverables": ["auth/middleware.js", "tests/auth.test.js"], "complexity": "medium", "research_time": "1 hour", "implementation_time": "4 hours"}
```
**Purpose**:
- Primary task management and tracking system
- Audit trail of accomplished work for any software project
- Complexity/time tracking for improved future estimation
- Project velocity metrics and learning insights

#### SESSION.md - Human Context Summary
```markdown
## User Authentication Implementation - Session 15
**Progress**: Implementing OAuth2 integration with existing user system
**Current Focus**: JWT token refresh mechanism and session management
**Blockers**: Need to research token storage security best practices
**Next Phase**: Integration testing with existing user database
```
**Purpose**:
- Human-readable session context for resumption after interruptions
- Historical documentation for understanding past decisions
- Knowledge preservation across development cycles
- Project progress communication

## üîÑ Pydantic AI Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol with Framework Enforcement

### Mandatory Startup Protocol for All Pydantic AI Agents
**Decision**: Framework-enforced protocol functions that all agents must execute
**Rationale**: 
- Code-enforced consistency prevents protocol drift across multiple agents
- Behavioral changes require updating only the protocol Python modules
- Type-safe enforcement patterns across all agent types
- Automatic validation and error detection
**Implementation**:
- Protocol modules in `.claude/agents/pydantic_ai/shared/protocols/` contain enforcement functions
- Each agent imports and executes required protocol functions via runner.py
- Pydantic models validate all protocol inputs/outputs
- Agents CANNOT proceed without successful protocol function execution - code-level enforcement

### Blocking/Notification System Design with Smart Monitoring & Compliance
**Decision**: Dynamic priority reprioritization via EVENTS.jsonl monitoring with context-aware timing and Queen oversight
**Rationale**: Balance coordination needs with uninterrupted deep work; framework-enforced compliance essential for multi-agent coordination
**Smart Monitoring Implementation**:
- **Active Coding Phase**: Suspend monitoring during Edit/Write/MultiEdit sequences, check after completion
- **Coordination Phase**: Mandatory 2-3 minute intervals during research/planning/dependencies  
- **Maximum Silence Rule**: Never exceed 10 minutes without checking regardless of activity
- **Queen Compliance Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of STATE.json and EVENTS.jsonl for violations
- **Progressive Correction**: Gentle reminders ‚Üí escalation for deliberate skips, delivered at natural workflow breaks

**Enforcement Pattern**:

1. **Worker Blocked Example**:
```json
{"type": "notification", "event": "worker_blocking", "agent": "frontend-worker", "target": "backend-worker", "data": {"blocked_on": "api_specification", "can_work_on": ["ui_components", "styling"], "priority": "high"}}
```

2. **Worker Response Pattern**:
```python
# Any worker monitors EVENTS.jsonl for relevant notifications
events = read_events_for_target("backend-worker")
blocking_events = filter_events(events, type="notification", event="worker_blocking")

if blocking_events:
    # Reprioritize local tasks based on blocking notifications
    for event in blocking_events:
        update_local_task_priority(event.blocking_task, priority="high")
```

3. **Unblocking Notification**:
```json
{"type": "notification", "event": "worker_ready", "agent": "backend-worker", "target": "frontend-worker", "data": {"unblocked": "api_specification", "available": ["/api/v1/users", "/api/v1/auth"], "documentation": "docs/api/README.md"}}
```

4. **Peer Cross-Escalation Example**:
```json
{"type": "escalation", "event": "peer_escalation", "agent": "frontend-worker", "target": "backend-worker", "data": {"blocker_id": "api_auth_spec", "escalation_reason": "timeout_exceeded", "timeout_reached": "5min", "alternative_work": ["ui_components", "styling"], "cross_domain_expertise_needed": "backend_api_design"}}
```

5. **Escalation Chain Failure & Recovery**:
```json
{"type": "escalation", "event": "escalation_failed", "agent": "backend-worker", "data": {"escalation_target": "analyzer-worker", "failure_reason": "worker_unavailable", "status_update": "blocked_done", "completed_work": ["auth_middleware_skeleton", "basic_validation"], "remaining_blockers": ["security_review", "token_implementation"], "queen_intervention_required": true}}
```

6. **Queen Blocked Task Resolution**:
```json
{"type": "coordination", "event": "blocked_task_resolution", "agent": "queen-orchestrator", "data": {"session_resumed": true, "blocked_tasks_found": 3, "resolution_actions": [{"task": "api_auth_spec", "resolution": "spawn_analyzer_worker", "context_provided": "security_requirements.md"}], "worker_respawn_queue": ["backend-worker", "frontend-worker"]}}
```

**Dynamic Escalation Actions**:
- **Timeout Calculation**: Base timeout √ó urgency multiplier √ó domain factor
- **Peer Cross-Escalation**: Direct worker-to-worker coordination before hierarchical escalation
- **Chain Failure Handling**: Workers mark "blocked_done", Queen resolves on respawn
- **Alternative Work Routing**: Blocked workers continue on non-dependent tasks
- **Resolution & Re-spawn**: Queen addresses blockers, re-activates blocked workers

### Universal Coordination Benefits
- **Dynamic Priority Management**: Critical blockers automatically reprioritize work across any project
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Non-blocking workers continue on alternative tasks regardless of domain
- **Resource Optimization**: Prevents worker idle time during dependencies in any development scenario
- **Communication Audit**: Complete trace of inter-worker coordination for any project type

---

## üéØ Session Templates & Patterns

### Session Template Strategy with Smart File Creation
**Decision**: Unified session template with complexity-based adaptation and smart file creation (no empty files)
**Rationale**: Eliminates template proliferation while preventing empty file clutter
**Implementation**: 
- Single `session-template.md` automatically adapts sections based on complexity
- **Smart File Creation**: Only create files/folders when content exists (lazy creation)
- **Consistent Structure**: Same architecture for all complexity levels for machine analysis
- No empty worker notes, research files, or decision documents
- Directories created on first write, not at session initialization
- Template consolidation completed: Removed 5 redundant template files with 80% overlapping structure

### Coordination Complexity with Smart Monitoring
**Decision**: Full EVENTS.jsonl coordination system for all project types with context-aware monitoring and zero-tolerance compliance
**Rationale**: 
- Enables efficient session resumption regardless of when interruption occurs
- Provides complete audit trail for understanding project decisions
- Prevents loss of coordination context during multi-session development
- Essential for tracking progress when sessions interrupted due to credit limits or terminal closures
- **Smart Enforcement**: Context-aware monitoring suspended during active coding, mandatory during coordination phases
- **Protocol Compliance**: Workers must fix violations immediately; Queen validates all logging and protocol adherence

---

## üìà Archivage & Knowledge Management

### Session Archive Strategy
**Purpose**: Comprehensive knowledge preservation for any software development project
**Archive Components**:

1. **Technical Decisions**: All worker independent decisions with full context and rationale
2. **Research Synthesis**: Context7 + Serena findings for reuse across projects
3. **Performance Metrics**: Actual vs estimated complexity for improved future planning
4. **Integration Patterns**: Successful implementation approaches for any technology stack
5. **Lessons Learned**: What worked well and what should be avoided in future projects

### Pattern Library Integration
**Decision**: Automatic pattern extraction from successful implementations across all projects
**General Pattern Categories**:
- **API Integration Patterns**: Successful REST/GraphQL/WebSocket implementation approaches
- **Authentication Patterns**: Proven auth implementation strategies  
- **Database Patterns**: Optimized data access and schema design approaches
- **Testing Patterns**: Effective testing strategies for different types of features
- **Architecture Patterns**: Successful system design approaches for scalability and maintainability

## ‚ö° Token Efficiency Rules

### Hard Failure Strategy
**Rule**: NEVER consume tokens on partial implementations due to critical infrastructure unavailability
**Implementation**:
- Local session initialization and validation
- Graceful degradation for research tools (Context7, Serena) when unavailable
- Clear error messages indicating required vs optional infrastructure
- Resume-ready state preservation to avoid re-work

### Research ROI Optimization
**Strategy**: Scale research investment to implementation complexity and type
- **New Features**: Full research protocol (Context7 + Serena + cross-worker synthesis)
